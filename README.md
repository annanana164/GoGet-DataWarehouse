# GoGet-DataWarehouse
Providing data-driven decisions to improve current car-sharing services from GoGet, through database design and data warehouse creation. This was conducted under INFS2608 Database Management & Big Data Infrastructures, course offered by the University of New South Wales.

<h2>1. Project Overview</h2> 

GoGet is a car sharing start-up company formed in 2003. The business of GoGet has expanded since it first started in 2003. Instead of just focusing on B2C (Business to Customer), it is now on B2B (Business to Business) environment. Today, GoGet has provided car-sharing services to the business as well. Thus, it starts to compete with car hire companies such as Hertz car rentals and Avis.</br>  <br>As a team of four, we were required to <b>redevelop GoGetâ€™s database and data warehouse</b> Hence, GoGet requested the development of a business intelligence platform to produce some basic reports. 

<h2>2. Problem Discovery</h2> 
<h3>ðŸš— Industry Overview:</h3>

- The impact of COVID-19, alongside the emergence of ride-share services like Uber and Ola within the last decade, has posed a threat towards the car-sharing industry.
- GoGetâ€™s estimated Revenue is $20.4M per year, which has declined from $30M in 2019.
- GoGetâ€™s main competitors - Hertz car rentals and Avis both offer car-sharing prices to businesses at an affordable rate.

<h3>ðŸ’¼ Company Overview:</h3>

- Toll fees are not accounted for in revenue calculations.
- Data on the Booking Time of each customer is not stored.
- Current marketing strategies not focused on enhancing website activity.

<h2>3. Our Approach</h2>

As a group of four, our approach involved designing an Entity Relationship Diagram to identify relationships among all entities and creating a Galaxy Schema for the Data Warehouse. We then proceeded with analysing the data in the Data Warehouse and presented the results through data visualisation via PowerBI.

 <h2>4. My Role</h2>
 
 - Mapped the relationships among all the entities through Galaxy Schema and Entity Relationship Diagram.
 - Created Data Warehouse and Materialized View using Oracle SQL Developer.
 - Perform Data Manipulation to create a local database.
